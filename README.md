# To-Do list
A To-do list app built using node and express.

This is not connected to a database so everytime the server is restarted all changes will be reverted

### How to run this application on your local machine?
1. Download this repo to your machine
2. Open Terminal in the project folder and type ```npm install``` This will install all the dependencies (I'm assuming Node is installed on your system)
3. Now type ```node app.js``` to start the server.
4. Open your browser and type ```http://localhost:3000/``` This accesses the main list
5. You can also access a separate work list ```http://localhost:3000/work```
